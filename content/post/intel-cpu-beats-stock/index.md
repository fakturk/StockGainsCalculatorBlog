**Loss**: $167.84 (28.49%)  
**Timeframe**: 9/1/2022 - 3/28/2025

#### **Why This Hurts**  
1. **Historic First**: Likely the only Intel CPU that outperformed its stock  
2. **Silver Lining**: At least the CPU still plays Cyberpunk 2077  
3. **Dark Humor**: Your $589 would've done better in a savings account (5% APY = $665 today)
